                    'Be sure to use the right type of ball (as in a wall-ball version of a medicine ball) and to throw against a surface that can take a beating (no drywall!). Even though power training focuses on the explosive concentric phase, we cannot achieve this without eccentrically lengthening, or stretching, the muscles. The idea is to spend as little time as possible transitioning from the stretching phase back into an explosive concentric movement.\n'
